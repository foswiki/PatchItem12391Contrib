---++ Usage

This extensions applies a "hotfix" for Item12285 and Item12391 to your Foswiki 1.1.0 thru 1.1.7 system.   Foswiki 1.0.x versions need to be manually patched.

<blockquote>
<div class="foswikiAlert">%X% *NOTICE:* This patch addresses a critical
Foswiki vulnerability and should be installed as soon as possible. </div>
</blockquote>

   * If a warning about MAKETEXT Rejected is displayed here, your system is patched for Item12285:  %MAKETEXT{"[_101]"}%
   * If ==[quant,4,singular,plural]== is displayed at the end of this line, your system is patched for Item12391: <b><tt>%MAKETEXT{" ~~[quant,4,singular,plural~~] "}%</tt></b>

When this extension is installed, it uses the Post-installation exit to apply any patch files found in the manifest.  This extension ships with a hotfix for the following items:

| *Original Issue* | *Patch File* | *Description* | *Applies to* |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12285][Item12285]] | =Item12285-001= | Addresses a vulnerability in Locale::Maketext. | Foswiki 1.1.0 - Foswiki 1.1.2 |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12285][Item12285]] | =Item12285-002= | Addresses a vulnerability in Locale::Maketext. | Foswiki 1.1.3 - Foswiki 1.1.6 |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12391][Item12391]] | =Item12391-001= | Addresses a vulnerability in Locale::Maketext. | Foswiki 1.1.0 - Foswiki 1.1.2 (Post Item12385) |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12391][Item12391]] | =Item12391-002= | Addresses a vulnerability in Locale::Maketext. | Foswiki 1.1.3 - Foswiki 1.1.6 (Post Item12385) |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12391][Item12391]] | =Item12391-003= | Addresses a vulnerability in Locale::Maketext. | Foswiki 1.1.7 |

Before any file is patched, a backup is copied to =working/configure/backup/&lt;Item12285-001-date-time&gt;=. Each file that is a candidate to be patched is backed up.  If the extensions is installed multple times, a new backup is made for each run, regardless of whether or not the patch will be applied.  For this patch, the following files are copied:
   * =lib/Foswiki/Macros/MAKETEXT.pm=

Patches are only applied if the target file is an _exact_ match to the original file.  There is no attempt to do "fuzzy" patching.   Note however that a patch can be built to cover multiple versions of the file.

There is no "dependency order" established between patches.  Patches are installed in order of their patch file name.

Patches will be mapped from the default Foswiki filename to the directory location used on the target system.

This patch does not include an uninstaller routine.  If this contrib is removed, the files will remain patched.
